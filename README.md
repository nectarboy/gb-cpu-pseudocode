a summary of all gb instructions in pseudocode

## Introduction
aight so while i was making my gameboy emu, i kinda had to scramble a lil to find sources which had all the gameboy instructions and actually explain what they did.

it was a lil messy at first, and some parts were just missing, so i was like fucc it why not just write a summary of all the instructions ?

## Feedback
i hope this summary is of help in any way !

if you find any mistakes, inconsistensies, or have any feedback, please lemme know !
